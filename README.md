The goal of this project was to extract, process, and analyze Hawaii climate data contained in a SQLite database, as well as construct an API for the raw climate data. Python with SQLAlchemy was utilized to store, inspect, and manipulate the data, while Python with Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib was used to generate meaningful visualizations in a common Jupyter Notebook. The API was developed in VS Code using Python with SQLAlchemy to store and inspect the data, while Python with Flask powered the development of the web interface.
